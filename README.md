The Legend of Zelda dungeon 1 remake + custom level
https://sparklehands.itch.io/zelda-1-dungeon-1-remake-custom-level

I designed the player mechanics including parts of movement, inventory, and weapon UI. I also designed the player's weapons which include the sword, bow and arrow, bomb, and boomerang. I designed the custom level layout and mechanic which is a bomb that can be moved around by the player's weapons then manually detonated when the player chooses.

Technologies used: Unity, C# in Visual Studio, Github, Jira.

Gold Spike Version Mac and Windows Deliverables

I was the only developer on this game. I designed and developed the map, the player controls, the abilities, enemy interactions, and the enemy AI.

I was inspired by the controls of RTS games like Starcraft 2 and League of Legends with the goal of infinite survival like Vampire Survivors to make this game. You move around the map like you're controlling an RTS hero while using cooldown based abilities to survive hordes of incoming enemies.
