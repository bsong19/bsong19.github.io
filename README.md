The Legend of Zelda dungeon 1 remake + custom level
https://sparklehands.itch.io/zelda-1-dungeon-1-remake-custom-level

I designed the player mechanics including parts of movement, inventory, and weapon UI. I also designed the player's weapons which include the sword, bow and arrow, bomb, and boomerang. I designed the custom level layout and mechanic which is a bomb that can be moved around by the player's weapons then manually detonated when the player chooses.

Technologies used: Unity, C# in Visual Studio, Github, Jira.
